    <h1> Sights and Strolls</h1>
        <h3>"There are so many ways to enjoy the waterfront strolling, biking, sliding down new slides, sitting and 
            taking in views of the water. All were designed with the goal of making this a welcoming and safe, and 
            inclusive space. We have built a waterfront tht truly reflects our original vision of creating a 
            waterfront for all." <i> - Angel Brady, Director for the office of the Waterfront and civic projects</i></h3>
